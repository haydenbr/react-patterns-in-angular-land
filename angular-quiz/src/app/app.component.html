<h2>Experiments</h2>

<h3>ControlValueAccessor as a render prop</h3>

<p>
	This is a nice way of reducing the boilerplate involved with using a control value accessor. Unforuntately, you can't really wrap it inside another component to make the wrapping component also act as a CVA. You can, but it's messy, which kind of defeats the purpose of reducing boilerplate anyways. So you can only really use it in a conjunction with another component at the moment you need that component to behave as a CVA.
</p>

<control-value-accessor [formControl]="formControl">
	<ng-template let-context="context">
		<button (click)="context.onChange(1)">1</button>
		<button (click)="context.onChange(2)">2</button>
		<button (click)="context.onChange(3)">3</button>
		<button (click)="context.onChange(4)">4</button>
		<button (click)="context.onChange(5)">5</button>
	</ng-template>
</control-value-accessor>

<form [formGroup]="formGroup">
	<control-value-accessor formControlName="formyMcFormface">
		<ng-template let-context="context">
			<button class="button primary" (click)="context.onChange('a')">a</button>
			<button class="button primary" (click)="context.onChange('b')">b</button>
			<button class="button primary" (click)="context.onChange('c')">c</button>
			<button class="button primary" (click)="context.onChange('d')">d</button>
		</ng-template>
	</control-value-accessor>
</form>

<h3>props directive</h3>

<p>
	The idea of this is to be able to set attributes and properties on dom elements and pass Inputs to child components in one fell swoop. This allows you to pass inputs and set attributes without knowing what they are. This can be helpful if you had a component/library that helped with accessability. It gave you the right attributes, you just had to put them on there. In standard angular land, the user (developer) would be responsible for knowing all the attributes and inputs coming back, maybe destructure an object, and then wire up everything correctly. So this requires a lot more cognitive overhead and more code.
