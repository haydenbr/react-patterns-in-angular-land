# React Patterns in Angular Land

React and Angular are the most widely used front-end libraries today. Both tools have undoubtedly enabled developers to become more productive, and both have seen a lot of maturation in the past couple years. Rather than pitting the two against each other in a high-stakes death match, perhaps there exist opportunities for developers of one library to learn from the best practices of the other. In this talk, though perhaps not as exciting as a bloody cage fight, weâ€™ll learn about the most popular patterns circulating in the React community and see how we can apply the same techniques to write better Angular code.
